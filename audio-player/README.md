# Audio-Player

This directory contains all the necessary modules to develop a custom audio player on Termux!!

## Setup

### Termux Installation and setup

You can look into the link below on installing and setting up Termux on your smartphone.

https://github.com/gadepall/fwc-1#fwc-1

Follow till step three of [Installing and Setting up Ubuntu on Termux
](https://github.com/gadepall/fwc-1#installing-and-setting-up-ubuntu-on-termux), and you are ready with the set-up.

### Audio Player setup

#### Virtual Environment setup

Once your Termux set-up is done, go to the terminal and run the following commands to install ```venv```:
```bash
apt update
apt install python3-venv
```
After successfully installing  ```venv``` run this command to create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv flaskenv
```

#### Clone this repository

Run the following command to clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PalrechaSayyam/EE23010.git
```
Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source flaskenv/bin/activate
```
#### Server setup

Once cloned, head to the audio-player directory using the command:
```bash
cd audio-player
```
Run the following command to install all the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Head to ```backend``` directory
```bash
cd backend
```
Change the path in the ```server.py```
```python
app = Flask(__name__, template_folder='/path-to-src-directory', static_folder='/path-to-src-directory')
```
```python
audio_directory = '/path-to-audio-directory'
```
Head to the ```backend``` directory to start the server:
```bash
python3 server.py
```
you can see there would be two links generated and would look something like this:
```bash
Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Running on http://192.0.0.2:5000
```
You can use either of the two links generated where ```5000``` is the port number.

```127.0.0.1``` is the loop back address, which allows you to access your Flask app on your local machine.

It's typically the IP address your company uses to access your Flask app.

After locating the above URL on your browser, head towards the ```play-random-audio``` route.

This would look something like this on the web browser:
```
https://your-ip-address:port-number/play-random-audio/
```
